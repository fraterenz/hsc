`hsc` can be ran from the command line: `hsc [OPTIONS] <DIR> <COMMAND>`, see also `hsc --help` and `hsc -h`.
There are two commands `<COMMAND>`, which are `moran` and `exp-moran`.
They have their options as well, see `hsc <COMMAND> -h`.

See [here](output.md) for more information about the output of the simulations and [here](https://fraterenz.github.io/hsc/hsc/) for the documentation.

Use the python package [hscpy](https://github.com/fraterenz/hscpy) to plot and process the output of the simulations.
